# Welcome to Skill17

## Overview
This is the organisation for all Skill17 related topics for your training for EuroSkills and WorldSkills competitions.

## Structure of Repositories
There are serveral repositories. Each repository represents a certain framework. Each framework has all the agreed upon libraries and plugins already installed. The idea is that you can clone that repository, run 'npm i', start the development server and begin coding.

## Docker Images
We have also created Docker images based on these repositories. The link to each Docker image can be found in the README of every repository.
